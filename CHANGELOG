	- Minor updates to URLs in files
	- Add sanity checking to gen-cert.sh like whats in gen-unifi-cert.sh

	- Updated gen-unifi-cert.sh to do more sanity checks and embed the
		needed IdenTrust cert so we don't need to include it separately.
	- Added -i option to gen-unifi-cert.sh so that we can reinject the
		cert without having to request a new cert from LE.  This is
		in case for some reason a previous cert isn't imported correctly.
